var_dumps --> var_paintings

##What is var_dump

var_dump is a work-in-progress chrome extension that will parse a var_dump out of the dom and make it pretty!
Also, Just FYI, we are now over on the chrome store: [Here!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/varmasterpiece/chfhddogiigmfpkcmgfpolalagdcamkl).

##Here's The Deal

Trying to read var_dumps is alot like tyring to read multiple lines of text without punctuation that wraps in a big block and makes you want to cry.

Actually, that is exactly what is it.

There are alternatives to making var_dumps readable, such as:
* importing libraries into php, but that doesn't seem like a good idea.
  * Not only do you now have unneccessary, third part code running on your web server, 
  * but it also sets you up to have different thigns running between your dev and live sites.
* You could write code above and below all of your var dumps, but that gets rid of the efficiency.
* You could use php's debugger and... oh wait, there isn't one

It is my conviction that a browser plugin is by far the best route to take, but I couldn't find any.

So here is mine. Hope it works for you!
